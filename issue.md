The impatient-mode can't handle .html files that have spaces in their names.
I guess there is an issue with the url encoding and the buffer name...

This is the error:

Forbidden
The requested URL is forbidden.

error: Buffer Problem%20S01%20E06.html is private or doesn't exist.

P.S: I know it's bad practice to put spaces in names and I can rename the files I
use after downloading them, but it would be cool to work with spaces anyway.
